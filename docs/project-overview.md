# CallThing.app — Project Overview

## Purpose

CallThing.app is a lightweight platform for **coordinating and tracking outreach to elected officials**. It helps organizations ensure their members make consistent, distributed contact with decision-makers—turning individual calls and emails into visible, collective impact.

## Goals

- **Mobilize members effectively:** Convert good intentions into steady weekly action.
- **Measure progress:** Provide organizers with clear dashboards that show campaign health and coverage.
- **Strengthen accountability:** Encourage members with achievable goals while giving organizers evidence of impact.
- **Enable transparency:** Aggregate results (e.g., number of calls per official, categorized responses) without exposing personal data.

## Who Uses It and Why

- **Organizers / Campaign Leads**: Define issues, create campaigns, set goals, and track progress across members and targets. They gain visibility into whether outreach is reaching critical mass or needs more engagement.
- **Volunteers / Members**: Join campaigns via a public link, receive a clear “next best call” to make, and log outcomes. They benefit from clarity, reminders, and personal progress tracking.
- **Partners / Funders**: See credible aggregate stats—how many members took action, which officials were contacted, and what responses were received. This makes outcomes reportable and trustworthy.

## MVP Feature Overview

- **Campaign creation:** Organizers define an issue, set member goals, and add scripts/talking points.
- **Target officials:** Database of officials with filters (office type, jurisdiction, party, etc.).
- **Public join links:** Easy onboarding without private invites.
- **Assignment engine:** Volunteers receive the “next best official” to contact based on location and campaign logic.
- **Call logging:** Volunteers record completed actions with optional notes and categorized responses.
- **Dashboards:** Rollups by campaign, official, and volunteer, showing both activity and outcomes.
- **Integrity checks:** Email verification, CAPTCHA, and rate limits to prevent fake activity.

## Future Scope

- **Official-level goals:** Organizers can set per-official targets (e.g., “500 calls to Senator Smith”) in addition to per-member quotas.
- **Hybrid goals model:** Balance individual accountability with strategic coverage of officials.
- **Enhanced assignment logic:** Prioritize officials not yet meeting thresholds.
- **Response analysis:** Cluster and summarize official responses, enabling campaigns to publish “what we heard” reports.
- **Follow-up prompts:** Reminders for officials who made commitments.
- **Cross-campaign history:** Track how responses evolve across multiple issues.

## Why It Matters

Most advocacy tools today are either **too generic** (mass petitions) or **too centralized** (campaigns can’t track member consistency). CommonLift fills the gap by giving grassroots organizers a **simple, credible way to coordinate recurring, distributed outreach**—and prove that many small actions add up to real influence.
